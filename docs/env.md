# Environment Variables and Toolchains

Every environment variable and toolchain dependency used anywhere in the repo is documented here.

## Toolchains

### Daml SDK

- Version: 2.9.5 (pinned, LTS)
- Install: `curl -sSL https://get.daml.com/ | sh -s 2.9.5`
- Verify: `daml version` shows `SDK version: 2.9.5`
- Used by: `services/canton-adapter/daml/*`
- Why pinned to 2.9: Daml 3.x is pre-GA as of 2026-04-25. Upgrade re-decision is out of scope for the governance spike.
